description: "three.js scene graph objects: Object3D transforms and hierarchy, Group, Mesh, InstancedMesh, SkinnedMesh, BatchedMesh, LOD, Line/LineLoop/LineSegments, Points, Sprite, Bone, Skeleton, ClippingGroup; interaction via Raycaster, Layers masks, and EventDispatcher patterns. Merges the former interaction scope—use for picking and layers; for pure vector math without scene graph use threejs-math; for playing skeletal clips use threejs-animation; for frustum culling internals see camera docs."

## When to use this skill

**ALWAYS use this skill when the user mentions:**

- Parent/child relationships, `position/rotation/scale`, `matrixAutoUpdate`, `updateMatrixWorld`
- Choosing mesh types: static vs instanced vs skinned vs batched LOD
- **Picking**: `Raycaster.setFromCamera`, `intersectObjects`, recursive flag, face/uv results
- **Layers**: selective visibility for cameras/lights/objects

**IMPORTANT: objects vs math**

| Need | Skill |
|------|--------|
| Scene graph + picking | **threejs-objects** |
| Box/ray math only | **threejs-math** |

**Trigger phrases include:**

- "Object3D", "InstancedMesh", "SkinnedMesh", "Raycaster", "layers"
- "父子节点", "射线拾取", "图层"

## How to use this skill

1. **Compose** scenes with `Group` and transforms; minimize deep hierarchies where possible.
2. **Instancing**: set per-instance matrices; understand `count` and frustum culling behavior.
3. **SkinnedMesh**: bind skeleton; clips in **threejs-animation**; skinning material flags in **threejs-materials**.
4. **Picking**: normalize device coords, set ray from camera, filter by layers, sort intersections.
5. **Events**: `EventDispatcher` on custom objects—patterns only, not DOM frameworks.
6. **Clipping**: `ClippingGroup` usage per docs when user needs sectional cuts.
7. **Dispose**: geometries/materials/textures when removing objects permanently.

See [examples/workflow-raycaster-pick.md](examples/workflow-raycaster-pick.md).

## Scope

- **In scope:** Object3D graph, renderable object types, raycasting, layers, dispatcher basics.
- **Out of scope:** Physics engines; XR input mapping (**threejs-webxr**).

## Common pitfalls and best practices

- Forgetting `updateMatrixWorld` before world-space ray tests on moved objects.
- Raycaster without `layers` set picks unintended objects—set masks consistently on camera and objects.
- InstancedMesh raycast hits need per-instance handling—check docs for your version.

## Documentation and version

`Object3D`, mesh types, `Raycaster`, and `Layers` are documented under [Objects](https://threejs.org/docs/#Objects) and [Core](https://threejs.org/docs/Raycaster.html) in [three.js docs](https://threejs.org/docs/). Behavior of picking and layers can shift slightly—link the exact page for the user’s three.js line.

## Agent response checklist

When answering under this skill, prefer responses that:

1. Link `Object3D`, `Mesh`, `InstancedMesh`, `Raycaster`, or `Layers` as needed.
2. Pair skeletal animation with **threejs-animation** and skinned mesh setup.
3. Route pure linear-algebra questions without a scene graph to **threejs-math**.
4. Route XR input to **threejs-webxr** when sessions/controllers are involved.
5. Mention `dispose()` for geometries/materials when removing objects permanently.
